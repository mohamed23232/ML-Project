# ML-Project

this is a project where I used classification models to classify the type of message received.

In this project, I wrangled and cleaned the data and then applied different models to find the best evaluation possible. 

I first examined the data and noticed some inconsistencies within the data so I handled it, After that came the feature selection process and I selected the feature based on the heatmap where I found the relations between columns. after that comes the machine learning process where I applied different models to find the best evaluation possible. In some models, I tried to tune the parameters using randomized search so that I maximize the model evaluation.  

The models applied in this project are Knn, Decision tree, random forest and XGB.
